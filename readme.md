A Cozy Kitchen's Creamy Mac & Cheese
INGREDIENTS
BREAD CRUMB TOPPING:
1 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
PASTA + SAUCE:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
5 cups milk (divided)
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
16 ounces grated cheese (a combo of swiss (7 ounces)/comte (1 ounces)/raclette (5 ounces)/cheddar (3 ounces), divided
1 pound of pasta of choice (I used cavatappi)
TO MAKE THE BUTTERY BREAD CRUMBS:
To a small saucepan, set over medium heat, melt the butter. When melted, add the breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt. Mix until the bread crumbs are thoroughly coated. Set aside.
TO MAKE THE MACARONI AND CHEESE:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter your 6-quart casserole dish and set aside. Reserve 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese for the layering we're going to do with it! But I like to set it aside now so I don't forget.
To a medium pot, set over medium heat, add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the flour and mix it together and cook the flour butter mixture for about 1 minute. Pour in the milk in two batches, stirring continuously in between additions.
Cook until it thickens up, about 2 to 3 minutes. It’ll start to bubble up and thicken. Give it a good whisk and be sure to get in those corners of the pan to get any floury bits up and mixed in. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Turn off the heat and whisk in the kosher salt, crushed red pepper, Dijon mustard and a few rounds of pepper. Add the grated cheeses and mix them in until they’re melted. Give it a taste and adjust the salt to taste. Cover the pot with a lid and set aside.
Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package’s instructions, about 6 to 7 minutes, until al dente.
Drain the pasta and then immediately run it under cold water to get rid of some of the starch. Give it a shake in the colander to shake off some of the excess water and then add it to the pot with the cheesy sauce. Mix until thoroughly combined.
Add half of it to the prepared baking dish and then sprinkle one layer of cheese. Then add the remaining macaroni on top and smooth it into an even layer and then top it with the reserved bread crumbs and remaining cheese.
Transfer it to the oven to bake for about 40 to 45 minutes, until the macaroni and cheese is bubbling and golden brown on top.
